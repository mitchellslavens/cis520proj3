			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A1: In a few paragraphs, describe the existing code for locating the
>> frame, if any, that contains the data of a given page.



---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A2: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

When searching for a frame, processes must first acquire the scan_lock,
this is done within try_frame_alloc_and_lock() function. This ensures
synchronicity when accessing the frames array. Additionally frames have
a lock member that prevent simultaneous access to the same frame. A lock
to a frame must be accessible, otherwise the try_frame_alloc_and_lock()
for-loop will attempt to acquire the lock for the next frame.

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B1: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe the algorithm used to choose a frame to evict.

The second for-loop of try_frame_alloc_and_lock() function is where a
frame is evicted. This for-loop iterates through the frames two times
to check the accessed status. First the frame is checked for an
associated page. If no associated page is found then we return the frame
immediately. Otherwise, page_accessed_recently() is called on the page
to check the accessed status. If recently accessed, then the loop moves
to the next frame changing the page status. If the page is not accessed
recently then the page is evicted and the frame is returned. If no
page is not recently accessed then the for-loop begins its second
iteration and now there is a higher chance of pages not being accessed
recently because of the previous calls to page_accessed_recently().

>> B2: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

From the write up, the stack should be extended when the page faults due to
a PUSH or PUSHA instruction. PUSHA can fault 32 bytes below the stack pointer.
So, faults within 32 bytes of the ESP should be valid. However, if extending the
stack will cause the stack to be larger than the max stack size (1MB), the
extension should obviously not happen. So, we first ensure that the extension will
not cause the stack to exceed the max stack size, and then we check if the fault is
within 32 bytes of the ESP. If both of these conditions are true, we extend the stack.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

We did not add or modify any structs.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

The threads contain files that are open by it. Memory mapped files are referenced
through a struct called "mapping". That struct holds a file and the range of
memory addresses that the file occupies. The swap table is used when evicting
non memory-mapped files, and also files that have not been modified.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

The page_allocate() function will only allocate a page if it is free and unmapped.
It will attempt to add the new mapping to the page table, and if an entry for the
page already exists, it will unmap and return NULL.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.

Everything will go through page_out(). We check in that function if the file
should be written to the disk or not. We write to the disk if the page isn't private.
Otherwise, we send the page to the swap partition.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

It was difficult until we understood the problem. It took a decent amount
of time to complete. Overall, not bad.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Yes, when working with the pages and frames.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

No, no.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

No.

>> Any other comments?

No.
